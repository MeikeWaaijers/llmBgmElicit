\title{Elicit Edge Inclusion Priors for Variable Pairs Using a LLM
that takes into account the remaining variables}
\usage{
elicitEdgeProbLite(
  context,
  variable_list,
  LLM_model = "gpt-4",
  update_key = FALSE,
  n_perm = NULL,
  seed = 123,
  main_prompt = NULL,
  display_progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{context}{Optional character string. Describes the research context to inform the LLM's evaluation.}

\item{variable_list}{A character vector with at least three variable names.}

\item{LLM_model}{A character string specifying the model to use. One of: \code{"gpt-4o"}, \code{"gpt-4-turbo"},
\code{"gpt-3.5-turbo"}, \code{"mixtral"}, or \code{"llama-3"}.}

\item{update_key}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, updates the API key used for the LLM call. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{n_perm}{Optional integer. Number of sampled permutations of remaining variables. Ignored for small sets.
If \code{NULL}, two permutations are generated by default. The maximum is 50.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility of the permutations. Default is \code{123}.}

\item{main_prompt}{Optional vector of character strings to be used as a system prompt for the LLM.
If \code{NULL}, a default system prompt is used. The prompt should be a single string.}

\item{display_progress}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, displays progress messages during processing. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"elicitEdgeProbLite"} containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{relation_df}}{A data frame with columns \code{var1}, \code{var2}, and \code{prob}, containing the estimated
prior probabilities of conditional associations between variable pairs.}
\item{\code{raw_LLM}}{A data frame of all raw LLM prompt-response data and token probabilities.}
\item{\code{arguments}}{A list of the function input arguments for reproducibility.}
}
}
\description{
This function uses a large language model (LLM) to evaluate whether conditional
associations (edges) exist between variable pairs in a Markov random Field graphical model. It optionally
includes study context and considers different orderings of remaining variables in the network
to estimate the prior probability of edge inclusion. Unlike the \code{elicitEdgeProb} function,
it does not include the decisions from the previous iterations for the remaining edges
in the prompt and is therefore cheaper to user. However it is also less accurate.
}
\details{
The function examines all unique variable pairs and, for each, prompts the LLM
to assess the presence of a conditional association, factoring in remaining variables in different
permutations. If context is provided, it is included in the prompt to inform decisions.

The returned edge inclusion probability reflects the average over all considered permutations
for each variable pair. The function handles both default and user-specified prompting structures.
