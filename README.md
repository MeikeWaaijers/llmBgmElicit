# llmBgmElicit 

NOTE: This package is still in development and a paper is in preparation.

The package **llmBgmElicit** provides tools to elicit prior edge inclusion 
probabilities using Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing Markov random 
field graphical models within the Bayesian graphical modeling (BGMs) framework. 
Currently the package supports the models provided by OpenAI. The elicited
prior can then be used in the **[`bgms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bgms/index.html)**,
**[`BDgraph`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BDgraph/index.html)** and **[`easybgm`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/easybgm/index.html)**
R packages for Bayesian graphical modeling.

The package interacts with the LLM to elicit edge inclusion probabilities under the independent Bernoulli prior on the network structure. 
The package includes full and simplified elicitation functions, tools for estimating prior distributions over graph structures, and utilities for parsing LLM outputs and managing API keys.

The output from the main function of, `llmBgmElicit`, which elicit prior inclusion probabilities under the Bernoulli prior, can be used
ti estimates the parameters of a **Beta-Bernoulli** or the Stochastic-Block model (SBM) prior.

This package is inspired by and partly based on the [`theoraizer`](https://github.com/MeikeWaaijers/theoraizer) package by Meike Waaijers.

## ðŸš€ Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```r

if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) { 
  install.packages("remotes")   
}   
remotes::install_github("sekulovskin/llmBgmElicit")
```

## Usage

### Bernoulli Structure Prior

Using the main function (recommended):

```r
library(llmBgmElicit)

result_lite <- elicitEdgeProb(
  context = paste(
    "This study examines the relationship between screen time,",
    "physical activity, and cardiovascular health."
  ),
  variable_list = c("Screen Time", "Physical Activity", 
  "Cardiovascular Health"),
  LLM_model = "gpt-5",
  n_perm = 2
)

print(result_lite$relation_df)
```

Using the cheaper lite function

```r
result_lite <- elicitEdgeProbLite(
  context = paste(
    "This study examines the relationship between screen time,",
    "physical activity, and cardiovascular health."
  ),
  variable_list = c("Screen Time", "Physical Activity", 
  "Cardiovascular Health"),
  LLM_model = "gpt-5",
  n_perm = 3
)

print(result_lite$relation_df)
```
### BetaBernoulli Structure Prior

```r
llm_out <- llmPriorElicitSimple(
  context = "Exploring cognitive symptoms and mood in depression",
  variable_list = c("Concentration", "Sadness", "Sleep"),
  n_rep = 3
)
beta_params <- betaBinParameters(llm_out)
print(beta_params)
```

### SBM Prior

```r
llm_out <- llmPriorElicitSimple(
  context = "Exploring cognitive symptoms and mood in depression",
  variable_list = c("Concentration", "Sadness", "Sleep"),
  n_rep = 3
)
cl <- sbmClusters(
  llmobject = llm_out,
  algorithm = "louvain",
  threshold = 0.5
)
cl$elicited_no_clusters
```
